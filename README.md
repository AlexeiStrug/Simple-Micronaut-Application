## Welcome to the Micronaut framework

Micronaut is a JVM-based framework for building lightweight, modular applications. Developed by OCI, the same company that created Grails, Micronaut is the latest framework designed to make creating microservices quick and easy.

While Micronaut contains some features that are similar to existing frameworks like Spring, it also has some new features that set it apart. And with support for Java, Groovy, and Kotlin, it offers a variety of ways to create applications.

## Main features 

One of the most exciting features of Micronaut is its compile time dependency injection mechanism. Most frameworks use reflection and proxies to perform dependency injection at runtime. Micronaut, however, builds its dependency injection data at compile time. The result is faster application startup and smaller memory footprints.

Another feature is its first class support for reactive programming, for both clients and servers. The choice of a specific reactive implementation is left to the developer as both RxJava and Project Reactor are supported.

Micronaut also has several features that make it an excellent framework for developing cloud-native applications. It supports multiple service discovery tools such as Eureka and Consul, and also works with different distributed tracing systems such as Zipkin and Jaeger.

It also provides support for creating AWS lambda functions, making it easy to create serverless applications.
